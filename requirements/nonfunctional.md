# Non-functional requirements
## Usability
As a user, I want the platform to be intuitive and easy to use so that I can place orders easily.
## Performance
As a user, I want the platform to be lightweight and responsive so that pages load quickly and interactions feel smooth.
## Reliability (crash safety)
As a user, I want my order details to not be lost if the system crashes so that I do not have to reorder or lose important information.
## Maintainability
As a developer, I want the system to be easy to maintain so that bugs and changes can be implemented with low effort and low risk.
## Extensibility
As a developer, I want the system to be easy to extend so that new meal types or dietary rules can be added without major refactoring.
